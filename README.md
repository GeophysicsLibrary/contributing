# Lesson Guidelines for the Geophysics Library

The goal of the Geophysics Library project is to provide modular computational
lessons for various topics in geophysics:

**Modular**: Lessons/activities should be designed to be taught in a single
session (~1-3 hours) and cover a specific topic (e.g., a case study, regional
isostasy models, etc). This maximizes the usability of the material across
different courses, which can vary a lot depending on instructor
preferences/styles.

**Computational**: Lessons should involve some form of computation that
students can follow and/or perform for themselves (implementing a model,
plotting a dataset, etc). Knowledge is easily accessible through internet
searches and text books. But open-source computational tools enable students 
to *put their knowledge into practice* through interactive exploration and 
looking at real world data.

TODO:

* Layout lesson design
* Technologies
* How to contribute a lesson
* Lesson types
